# Deep Neural Network - Application

Congratulations! Welcome to the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will now use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.

In the second exercise, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this assignment, you will:

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
